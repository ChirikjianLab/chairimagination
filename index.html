<p><b>Figure 1</b>: Chair Affordance Imagination. The imagination is composed of two steps: stable pose imagination <br>
 and functional pose imagination. Given an arbitrarily oriented object, we first imagine the stable poses of the <br>
 object. Then, we proceed to imagine the functional pose which is able to afford the functionality of sitting among <br>
 the stable poses. <br>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
For robots to exhibit a high level of intelligence 
in the real world, they must be able to assess objects 
for which they have no prior knowledge. Therefore, it 
is crucial for robots to perceive object affordances by 
reasoning about physical interactions with the object. 
In this paper, we propose a novel method to provide 
robots with an imagination of object affordances using 
physical simulations. The class of chair is chosen here 
as an initial category of objects to illustrate a more 
general paradigm. In our method, the robot "imagines" 
the affordance of an arbitrarily oriented object as a 
chair by simulating a physical "sitting" interaction 
between an articulated human body and the object. This 
object affordance reasoning is used as a cue for object 
classification (chair vs non-chair). Moreover, if an 
object is classified as a chair, the affordance 
reasoning can also predict the upright pose of the 
object which allows the sitting interaction to take place. 
We call this type of poses the functional pose. We 
demonstrate our method in chair classification on synthetic 
3D CAD models. Although our method uses only 20 models 
or training, it outperforms appearance-based deep learning 
methods, which require a large amount of training data, when
the upright orientation is not assumed to be known as a 
priori. In addition, we showcase that the functional pose
predictions of our method on both synthetic models and real 
objects scanned by a depth camera align well with human judgments.
